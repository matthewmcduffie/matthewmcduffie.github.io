## About Me

Hello, and welcome. My name is Matt. I’m a data-minded technologist with a background that blends traditional IT management and modern data analytics.

For years, I’ve managed servers, networks, and secure systems across multiple offices, ensuring compliance, uptime, and reliability. That hands-on experience taught me the importance of structure, documentation, and process — all of which carry directly into the data field.

Today, I focus on **data analytics and visualization**, using tools like **Python**, **SQL**, **Plotly**, and **Streamlit** to turn raw information into meaningful insight. I enjoy exploring datasets, building dashboards, and uncovering patterns that tell real stories.  

Alongside analytics, I maintain a strong technical foundation in **server administration, database management, and security**, particularly within regulated industries such as healthcare where **HIPAA compliance** and data integrity are critical.  

Outside of work, I’m always experimenting with automation, exploring open-source tools, and writing about how technology and data intersect. I believe clear, practical systems — both technical and human — make for better work and better results.
