    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>Hello, and welcome. My name is Matt. I’m a data-minded technologist with a background that blends traditional IT management and modern data analytics.</p>

    <p>For years, I’ve managed servers, networks, and secure systems across multiple offices, ensuring compliance, uptime, and reliability. That hands-on experience taught me the importance of structure, documentation, and process — all of which carry directly into the data field.</p>

    <p>Today, I focus on <strong>data analytics and visualization</strong>, using tools like <strong>Python</strong>, <strong>SQL</strong>, <strong>Plotly</strong>, and <strong>Streamlit</strong> to turn raw information into meaningful insight. I enjoy exploring datasets, building dashboards, and uncovering patterns that tell real stories.</p>

    <p>Alongside analytics, I maintain a strong technical foundation in <strong>server administration, database management, and security</strong>, particularly within regulated industries such as healthcare where <strong>HIPAA compliance</strong> and data integrity are critical.</p>
